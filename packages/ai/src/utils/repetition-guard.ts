/**
 * Design, calibration, and implementation credit: @r0h1tb, from #1099 (closed,
 * unmerged, via the maintainer's standard backlog-sweep note citing #1165 as
 * "covering" this -- the underlying bug is still live on current main,
 * confirmed by porting this module and #1099's own tests here and verifying
 * the end-to-end test fails on pre-fix main). Ported verbatim against current
 * main, with the same detection algorithm, calibration data, and rationale.
 *
 * Detects degenerate, non-progressing generation while a stream is still
 * running, so the request can be aborted instead of burning the whole output
 * budget.
 *
 * The failure this exists for (#1029): a thinking stream settled into emitting
 * `"The the the the the the the "` back to back 2,366 times — 79,222 characters
 * — and only stopped when the user aborted by hand. Provider streamers are
 * faithful assemblers and never inspect content, request construction attaches
 * no repetition penalties, and the agent loop treats a completed stream as
 * progress, so nothing owned this.
 *
 * Two shapes are detected, because a loop rarely stays verbatim for long:
 *
 * 1. **Periodic tail.** The tail of the stream is one short unit repeated many
 *    times. Found with the KMP failure function, which yields the smallest
 *    period of a string in O(n) — no scanning of candidate period lengths.
 * 2. **Novelty stall.** The tail keeps restating the same content with drift, so
 *    verbatim periodicity misses it. Measured as distinct word trigrams over
 *    total word trigrams: a loop reuses the same trigrams, legitimate output
 *    does not.
 *
 * The novelty threshold is calibrated, not guessed. Measured over the corpus in
 * `test/repetition-guard.test.ts`:
 *
 *     loops   verbatim 0.001   drifting 0.136
 *     legit   enumerated analysis 0.286   markdown table 0.485   JSON 0.513
 *             source code 0.611   numbered list 0.671   prose 1.000
 *
 * 0.20 sits in the gap with margin on both sides. Word-trigram Jaccard between
 * paragraphs was tried first and rejected: drifting loops scored 0.38-0.58
 * while structurally similar legitimate paragraphs scored in the same band, so
 * it could not separate them at any threshold.
 *
 * False positives are the real risk: legitimate reasoning repeats phrases, and
 * code, tables and lists are structurally repetitive. Every threshold below is
 * deliberately conservative, and the guard only looks at a bounded tail, never
 * the whole transcript.
